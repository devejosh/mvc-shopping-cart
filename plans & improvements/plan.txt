**Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Shopping Cart in Python and Flask**

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install Python if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Python website.
   - Install Flask by running `pip install Flask` in your command line.

2. **Project Structure**:
   Organize your project into folders. Here's a basic structure:

   ```
   shopping_cart_app/
   ├── app.py
   ├── templates/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   ├── cart.html
   │   └── product.html
   ├── static/
   │   └── style.css
   ├── data/
   │   └── products.json
   └── venv/ (Your virtual environment or conda)
   ```

3. **Create the Flask App**:
   In your `app.py`, start with the following basic setup:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, render_template

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def index():
       # Implement this route to display a list of products
       return render_template('index.html')

   @app.route('/cart')
   def cart():
       # Implement this route to display the shopping cart
       return render_template('cart.html')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

4. **Templates and Static Files**:
   Create the HTML templates in the `templates` folder (e.g., `index.html`, `cart.html`, `product.html`) and any necessary CSS files in the `static` folder (e.g., `style.css`). These templates will be used to display the products, shopping cart, and individual product details.

5. **Data Model**:
   Decide how you'll store product data. You can use a simple JSON file to start with. Create a `products.json` file in the `data` folder and define your product data there.

6. **Implement Product Listing**:
   In the `index` route, read the product data from the JSON file and pass it to the template to display a list of products. You can use Flask's `render_template` and `jinja2` template engine for this.

7. **Add to Cart Functionality**:
   Implement the logic to add products to the shopping cart. You can use session variables to store the cart's content. You'll need to handle both the "Add to Cart" button in the product view and the updating of the cart in the shopping cart view.

8. **Display Cart Content**:
   In the `cart` route, retrieve the contents of the shopping cart from the session and display it.

9. **Update Cart and Calculate Totals**:
   Implement the functionality to update the cart (e.g., remove items, change quantities) and calculate the cart total.

10. **Checkout and Payment**:
    Implement the checkout functionality. You might want to integrate with a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal for real payments. For testing, you can simulate the payment process.

11. **Session Management**:
    To store the cart data, you'll need to set up Flask's session management. You can use the `flask.session` object to store and retrieve cart data.

12. **User Authentication** (Optional):
    If you want to build a more advanced shopping cart with user accounts and order history, you'll need to implement user authentication and a database for storing user-related data.

13. **Testing**:
    Test your application thoroughly. Use tools like `unittest` or `pytest` to create unit tests for your code.

14. **Deployment**:
    Once your shopping cart application is complete, you can deploy it to a web server or a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Heroku, AWS, or PythonAnywhere.
